Lab 8: Jinx Hallway Navigation Methods



We found out that by linking together previous nodes and modifying slightly the new nodes, we were able to get the robot 
to move like in each of the three previous problem assignments. The hardest part was figuring out how to have the robot move 
after undoing the e stop without already proceeding on it's path while e stopped.
