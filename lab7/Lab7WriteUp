Lab 8: Jinx Hallway Navigation Methods



For the lab:

Combine PSs 6 7 and 8

Have Jinx start in front of the elevator, facing the lab door.  Command Jinx to go to the service elevator, turn around, and return to the original starting position.  
While en route, Jinx must stop if there is an obstruction (e.g., walk in front of the robot).  

Demonstrate 3 different modes of motion control:

1) open-loop commands (graceful alarm responses, multiline path following from PS6)

2) linear feedback control based on odometry (odometry closed-loop path following from PS7)

3) linear feedback based on integrated odometry and AMCL (AMCL closed-loop path following from PS8)

Submit your code, video and a report on your findings.
